rule 1
rule 2
naked triples
most constrained

grade each problem
is his conjecture correct?
average number of filled in values by rules
backtracking w/ and wo/ naked triples

Try each problem:
	With rule 1 (Easy?)
	Rule 1 and rule 2 applied together over and over (Medium?)
	"                " and naked triples, report unfilled squares before backtracking, and compare w/ difficulty (H & E?)
	Backtracking.
		Count assignments. How many problems was it helpful in, and how much?
			Most-constrained v. random
			Naked triples v. no naked triples
