Expand knowledge base as agent moves through environment, w/ help of prover9
get_action as shows on page 270. Modify alg so that agent only shoots if it has
 sensed a blocking stench.
informed search procedure
   evaluation function / heuristic
Should display the solution for a single problem, as well as the stats for the
 solution of multiple problems

Knowledge base:
there is only one wumpus in an environment
squares adjacent to a wumpus are smelly, keep in mind that it may be dead though
squares adjacent to a pit are breezy
a square is safe iff it contains no wumpus and no pit
if wumpus_alive is false than there is no wumpus on any square
the square that glitters contains gold
once the shoot action occurs, have_arrow is false
once the scream percept occurs, wumpus_alive is false
if facing_north and turn_right, then facing_east
    eight implicit combinations of facing direction and action
the agent's location at some time is based on the last action taken, the last
 location, and the bump percept

Vocab:
squares [x,y]
unvisited([x,y])
pit([x,y])
breeze([x,y])
stench([x,y])

wumpusAlive()
ok([x,y])
at(Agent/Wumpus, square, time)
adjacent([x,y],[a,b])

Actions:
forward
turn(left) and turn(right)
grab
