<H2>     Vacuum-Cleaning Agents </H2> 
<H2> Due: Oct 12'th,  8:30 AM </H2> 
</center>
<p> In this assignment you will design and implement 3 different 
vacuum-cleaning agents. You can do this and other programming 
assignments in teams of 2 students. You can use any programming language. 
</p> 

<p> The vacuum cleaner environment 
consists  of n X m empty rectangular room, where each square has a p% chance 
of containing dirt. There are 3 percepts: a wall sensor = 1 if the machine 
has a wall right in the front and 0 otherwise, a dirt sensor = 1 if the 
square contains dirt, and a home sensor = 1 if the agent is home (the starting
location). Five actions are available: go forward, turn right by 90 degrees, 
turn left by 90 degrees, suck
up dirt, and turn off. The agent always starts in the bottom leftmost corner
oriented upwards. It is evaluated by 
the total number of clean cells as a function of 
the number of actions taken. (Plot the number of clean cells 
vs. the number of actions taken). 

Design and implement three different agents and experiment with 
m=n=10 and p=100%. The three agents are listed as follows. In each case, the 
agent program should be organized as a list of if-then rules. The first rule
whose condition evaluates to TRUE will ``fire,'' which means the corresponding
action is executed. If the agent program is deterministic then there is only 
one action. If it is stochastic, then there are several actions, and 
each action will be chosen with some probability. For example, 
the rule "if wall then turn-left 0.5 turn-right 0.5" will choose turn-left 
and turn-right with equal probability if the wall sensor is ON. 
 
<ol> 
<li> A simple memoryless deterministic reflex agent. 
<li> A randomized reflex agent that can choose
 actions randomly based on sensor readings. 
<li> A deterministic reflex agent with a small amount (2 to 3 bits) of memory. 
When executing each action, the agent simultanesouly sets or resets these 
bits according to how you specify. It checks all these bits while 
simultaneously sensing all the other percepts. 
</ol> 

For the random agent, repeat the experiment 50 times and plot the average 
performance over the 50 runs. For other agents, one run each would do. 
Write a brief report (3-5 pages). Your report should look like a 
research paper with abstract, introduction (a summary of the goals and 
results), formal description of the agents in some rule-like notation, 
experimental setup, results with 3 plots, and the discussion. You should
include answers to the following questions in your papers. Please 
feel free to add any other important observations as well. 

<ol> 
<li> Describe the idea behind the design of each of your agents. Use diagrams 
and english as appropriate. 

<li> Describe all your agents as if-then rules. 

<li> What is the best possible performance achievable by any memory-less 
reflex agent in this domain? What prevents a memory-less 
reflex agent from doing very well in this task? 

<li> How well does the random agent perform? Do you think that this is 
the best possible performance achievable by any random agent? Why or 
why not? Give a table showing the number of 
actions it took to clean 90% of the room for each trial. What is the 
average of these numbers for the best 45 trials? 
What are the costs and benefits of randomness in agent design? 

<li> How does the memory-based deterministic agent perform compared 
to the random agent? Was it able to completely clean the room? Was it 
able to shut itself off after it is done? If it did, how many actions 
did it take to do this? Can the agent be improved any further with more 
memory than you used? Why or why not? 

<li> What did you learn from this experiment? Were you surprised 
by anything? 
</ol>
